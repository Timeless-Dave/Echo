- **Evidence files** (15 points): Supporting documentation
- **Additional factors** (15 points): Various quality indicators

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Real-time scoring as user types
useEffect(() => {
  const calculateAIScore = () => {
    let score = 0
    // Title scoring logic
    if (title.length > 10) score += 20
    // Category keywords detection
    if (title.includes("harassment")) score += 15
    // Description depth
    if (description.length > 200) score += 15
    // ...additional criteria
    setAiScore(Math.min(score, 100))
  }
}, [title, description, category, files])
```

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy Features**

### Current Implementation:

_**User**_

what if I want to do npm run dev, npm install and all which route of the code will I do all those

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about the development workflow - specifically where they would run npm commands like `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start working with this codebase. They want to know the correct directory/route to execute these commands.

Looking at the project structure, I can see there's a `package.json` file in the root directory, which contains the npm scripts and dependencies. This means the npm commands should be run from the root directory of the project.

Let me provide a clear answer about the development workflow and where to run these commands.</details></think>

---

Based on the codebase structure, here's exactly where and how to run the development commands:

## 📍 **Root Directory Commands**

You should run all npm commands from the **root directory** of the project (the `Echo/` folder), where the `package.json` file is located.

### **Directory Structure:**
```
Echo/                  ← RUN COMMANDS HERE (ROOT)
├── package.json       ← This file defines your npm scripts
├── pnpm-lock.yaml    ← Lock file (using pnpm, not npm)
├── app/
├── components/
├── lib/
└── ...other files
```

## 🚀 **Development Workflow**

### **1. Navigate to Project Root:**
```bash
cd Echo
# or
cd /c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Echo
```

### **2. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
# The project uses pnpm (faster than npm)
pnpm install

# OR if you prefer npm
npm install
```

### **3. Start Development Server:**
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm dev

# OR using npm
npm run dev
```

### **4. Available Scripts (from package.json):**
```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
```

## 🔧 **What Happens When You Run These Commands:**

### **`pnpm install` / `npm install`:**
- Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`
- Creates `node_modules/` folder
- Updates lock file (`pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package-lock.json`)

### **`pnpm dev` / `npm run dev`:**
- Starts Next.js development server
- Usually runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Enables hot reloading (changes appear instantly)
- Runs TypeScript compilation
- Enables Tailwind CSS processing

## ⚡ **Quick Start Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd Echo

# 2. Install dependencies (choose one)
pnpm install        # Recommended (faster)
# OR
npm install

# 3. Start development server (choose one)
pnpm dev           # Recommended
# OR
npm run dev

# 4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

## 📝 **Important Notes:**

1. **Lock File**: The project has `pnpm-lock.yaml`, suggesting **pnpm** is the preferred package manager
2. **Root Directory**: Always run commands from the `Echo/` root where `package.json` exists
3. **Port**: Development server typically runs on `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Hot Reload**: Changes to files will automatically refresh the browser

## 🛠️ **First Time Setup:**

```bash
# Complete first-time setup
cd Echo
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the Echo landing page with the hero section, navigation, and all the features we analyzed!

The development server will watch for file changes and automatically reload the page when you modify any code in the `app/`, `components/`, or other source directories.

_**User**_

what can I do

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is getting "command not found" errors for both `npm` and `pnpm`. This means they don't have Node.js installed on their system, which includes npm by default. I need to help them install Node.js first, then they can proceed with the development setup.</details></think>

---

You need to install **Node.js** first! The error shows that neither `npm` nor `pnpm` are recognized, which means Node.js isn't installed on your system.

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Solution:**

### **1. Install Node.js:**

**Option A: Official Node.js Installer (Recommended)**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS version** (Long Term Support)
3. Run the installer (it includes npm automatically)
4. Follow the installation wizard

**Option B: Using Winget (Windows Package Manager)**
```powershell
# If you have winget installed
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

**Option C: Using Chocolatey**
```powershell
# If you have Chocolatey installed
choco install nodejs
```

### **2. Verify Installation:**
After installing Node.js, restart your PowerShell/Command Prompt and verify:

```powershell
# Check Node.js version
node --version
# Should show something like: v20.x.x

# Check npm version  
npm --version
# Should show something like: 10.x.x
```

### **3. Install pnpm (Optional but Recommended):**
Since the project uses `pnpm-lock.yaml`, install pnpm for better performance:

```powershell
npm install -g pnpm
```

### **4. Now You Can Run the Development Commands:**

```powershell
# Navigate to your project (you're already there)
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Echo

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# OR
npm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
# OR  
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 **Complete Setup Process:**

```powershell
# 1. After installing Node.js, restart PowerShell and verify
node --version
npm --version

# 2. Install pnpm globally (recommended)
npm install -g pnpm

# 3. Install project dependencies
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Echo
pnpm install

# 4. Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## 🌐 **What to Expect:**
- After `pnpm install`: Dependencies will be downloaded and installed
- After `pnpm dev`: Development server will start, typically on `http://localhost:3000`
- You'll see output like:
```
▲ Next.js 15.2.4
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Ready in 2.3s
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**
1. **Always restart your terminal** after installing Node.js
2. **Use pnpm** instead of npm for this project (it's faster and matches the lock file)
3. **Check Windows PATH** if commands still don't work after installation
4. **Run as Administrator** if you encounter permission issues

Once Node.js is installed, you'll be able to run all the npm/pnpm commands and start developing with the Echo platform!

---

```bash
echo "Checking if server is running..." && timeout 5 > nul && echo "Server should be ready!"
```

```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Echo> echo "Checking if server is running..." ; timeout 5 > nul ; echo "Server
 should be ready!"
Checking if server is running...
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Echo>
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The timeout command didn't work properly, but that's okay. The development server should be running in the background. Let me check what URL it's running on. Usually Next.js runs on localhost:3000.</details></think>
